## Alvaro Nieto | Web developer
I'm a Full-Stack Web-Developer with a strong profile on modern web development MERN (MongoDB, Express, REACT.js, Node.Js) Stack Front To Back. I have a background in Academia, where I learn to be creative, to investigate and develop projects, bring solutions, and many others. My previous career as a scientist brought me close to my true passion: develop web applications. I enjoy the process of building web-pages because I'm a naturally curious person with enthusiasm to understand technical challenges. Being a web-developer allows me to use my aptitudes like finding solutions, learning and creating. I seek a role as a web developer at a company where I can learn, grow, and continue to master the craft.
